      "description": "The modern renaissance of Mercedes in Formula 1 began with the creation of an official team for 2010, the platform for meteoric ascension in the order of the Grand Prix. The team generated a great deal of emotion from the beginning with the sensational return of Michael Schumacher, but the headlines soon followed on the track: three podiums in their debut season, all through Nico Rosberg, who then achieved a double pole / victory in China in 2012. The following season was paired with Lewis Hamilton, the duo went on to have some epic battles for the title when the Silver Arrows barrier everything in front of them to become one of the most dominant forces of the modern era of F1, until Red Bull arrived and stole that crown. However, with the race winner George Russell now associated with the rising star Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes is still one of the teams to beat.",
